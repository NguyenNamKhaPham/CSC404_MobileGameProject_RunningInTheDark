Thank You for checking out our package!

Package contains 4 free pixel/boxy-stylized trees, with diffuse texture.
Because we are new here, we need a lot of feedback about our assets so we encourage You to post feedback about this package in our Unity forum thread
(link below) or Facebook.
Best suggestions will be promoted with vouchers for future packs!!!!
Have fun!

So meshes are in one folder, inside of it You can find also material folder with material and textures.
Pixel_Trees_D is the diffuse texture.

Trees has baked vertex colours but currently we do not provide shader to use it. Also we're not sure how they will behave in engine.
If You have knowledge about it, how to use the correctly, please let us know on forum thread!

There is also preview scene that we used for screenshots on Asset Store. Nothing fancy.

If You have feedback, problems, questions, anything - please contact us via email, forum or facebook profile.

-------------CHANGES--------------
First version was supporting another texture that contained color with baked AO, but we've decided to resign from this solution - because it given 
similar results to standard lightmaps and have to have wierd second uv channel.

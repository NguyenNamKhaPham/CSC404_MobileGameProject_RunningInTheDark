Running in the Dark is a mobile puzzle solving game (for iOS and Android) that you play as a pumpkin trying to escape from the map. To unlock the exit door, you need to collect all the candies while always staying in the dark. Once you contact the any light, you die. However, you have the power of manipulating the surrounding objects to change the state of the light such as pushing boxes to create shadows, turn off lights, or even move the light sources.

Running in the Dark was a game project developed by a group of 3 programmers as students of University of Toronto and 5 artists as students of Centennial College. We developed them using Unity in C# language in over 2 months.
